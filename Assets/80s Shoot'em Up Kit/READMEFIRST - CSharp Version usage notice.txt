This is the very first release of the CS conversion of '80s Shoot'em Up Kit'.
I'll do my best to keep it updated, but please note that original version will be prioritized.

If you wish to use this CSharp version instead of UnityScript :
The archive contains the complete project converted to CSharp.
So decompress the Winrar archive in a new location - DO NOT decompress in your current UnityScript project.

As this is the first release, please notice you could encounter some bugs or other unexpected problems.
In case of trouble, please let me know ( contact@eti-software.com ).
