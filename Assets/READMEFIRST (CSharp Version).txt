If you wish to use this CSharp version instead of UnityScript :
The archive contains the complete project converted to CSharp.
So decompress the Winrar archive in a new location - DO NOT decompress in your current UnityScript project.
As this is the first release, please notice you could encounter some bugs or other unexpected problems.
In case of trouble, please let me know ( contact@eti-software.com ).
